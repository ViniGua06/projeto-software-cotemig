            <p id="paragrafh-welcome">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
             and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
             text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
             and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
             five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
             remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
             with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
             more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
             versions of Lorem Ipsum.
